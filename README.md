mira-i18n
=========

Internationalization Package for Meteor JS

Motivation
----------

I inspired by the i18n package in [Telescope](https://github.com/SachaG/Telescope).
It is simple. I loved the simplicity.
However, it didn't satify me. 

First, it has a default language which I do not want.
Second, I want a hierachy structure, not serial structure.
Third, I also want modular structure.

So I made it from the scratch.

Features
--------

Main features are:
 - It is simple too.
 - It is tree structured.
 - It is separatable.

How to use
